# Project Paths

Paths is a WIP tool for automatic software models repairing using reinforcement learning (Q-Learning at the moment).
This code corresponds to an evaluation in where we fix 100 mutant errors produced with AMOR Ecore mutator tool (https://bit.ly/2Sse4kU).
All mutants are inside "tofix" folder.
Fixed models are generated in "fixed" folder.
It is necessary to manually delete models in fixed to produce new models.
